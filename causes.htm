<p>Understanding the causes of homelessness in Ireland is vital to challenge the stereotypes and stigma surrounding one of Irish societyâ€™s most pressing issues.

    Generally, the experiences that lead to homelessness are underpinned by the following types of causes: structural, institutional and personal.
    
    On this page, we'll go into more details on each type of cause to give you a broader view of who may be impacted by homelessness in Ireland and why that may be the case.
    
    Following that, you'll have an opportunity to explore some of the solutions to ultimately end homelessness in Ireland, including ways in which Peter McVerry Trust is working to minimise the risk of people experiencing homelessness in the future. </p>
