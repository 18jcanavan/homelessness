        <p>Perhaps you have lost your rented accommodation, or had to move out of your home because your relationship has broken down. You may be staying with family or couch surfing with friends. Or you may be homeless for more complex reasons and have additional needs due to addiction or mental health issues.</p>

        <p>There is no legally protected right to adequate shelter and housing In Ireland. However, local authorities have a responsibility to provide housing for adults who cannot afford it themselves, and Tusla must provide accommodation for children who are homeless or in need of care.</p>

        <p>While local authorities do not have a statutory obligation to house people, they do have general responsibility under the Housing Act 1988 to provide housing for adults who cannot afford to provide it for themselves. They may help with accommodation either by providing housing directly or through arrangements with voluntary housing organisations and other voluntary bodies. They may also provide funding to voluntary bodies for emergency accommodation and for long-term housing for homeless people.</p>

        <p>The number of people who are homeless is monitored to ensure there are sufficient homeless services and to help develop housing policy. This is done in a number of ways:</p>
